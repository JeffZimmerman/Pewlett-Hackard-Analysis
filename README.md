# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to take information from the existing company database and identify points of insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami," or the expected retirement of large numbers of employees.

## Results
* The database needed long-overdue updating, particularly noticeable by the presence of duplicate entries for the same employees.
* These duplicate entries were a result of many employees staying with the company over time but changing titles or being promoted.
* By filtering data by the age of each employee and by omitting outdated entries, the company can have a better picture of which employees are most likely to retire soon. 
* This analysis also allows the identification of a younger cohort, identified by birth date and job title, that would benefit from a mentorship program as they age with the company.

## Summary
### Senior Roles need to be filled, and the company has a surfeit of senior talent for mentoring the next generation.
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

> The analysis demonstrates some notable facts: There are roughly twice as many Senior Engineers as Engineers. Similarly, there are more than twice as many Senior Staff as Staff. The company is top-heavy with senior employees, so an effective mentorship program will be necessary to empower the younger cohort that will be needed to replace anticipated retirees.

> The analysis has been useful not only in gaining a better picture of the retirement-ready employees, it can also provide insight into a younger cohort. There are sufficient numbers of mentorship-ready employees across departments, such that the upcoming "silver tsunami" need not overwhelm the company.
